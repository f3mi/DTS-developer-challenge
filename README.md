# DTS Developer Challenge – Task Management System

A full-stack application for managing caseworker tasks, developed as part of the HMCTS DTS Developer Technical Test. This system allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks, with a simple and user-friendly interface.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Caseworkers at HMCTS require a system to manage their daily tasks efficiently. This project includes:

- A backend API to perform full CRUD operations.
- A frontend interface for interacting with tasks.
- Validation, error handling, unit tests, and database integration.
- User authentication and session management.
- Interactive dashboard with real-time task metrics.

## 🧪 Running the Application

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
- PostgreSQL (v12 or higher)
- Git

### Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create and configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit the .env file with your database credentials and settings
```

### Database Setup

```bash
# Create the database (if it doesn't exist yet)
# Using PostgreSQL command line or a GUI tool like pgAdmin
createdb task_management

# Run database migrations first - this creates all required tables
npm run migration

# IMPORTANT: Always run migrations before seeders to avoid errors
# Seed the database with sample data
npm run seed:ordered  # Seeds users first, then tasks with proper references
```

### Running the Backend

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev  # Runs on http://localhost:3000 by default

# For production
npm start
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create and configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env  # Set API URL if different from default

# Start the development server
npm run dev  # Starts the frontend on localhost:5173
```

### Running Tests
```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors like `relation "Tasks" does not exist` when running seeders:
1. Ensure migrations have been run first
2. If problems persist, you may need to recreate the database:
   ```bash
   dropdb task_management
   createdb task_management
   npm run migration
   npm run seed:ordered
   ```

## 🔒 Authentication

The system uses JWT-based authentication:

- Register with a name, email, and password
- Login with email and password
- Automatic session expiry after 24 hours
- Idle timer to automatically log out inactive users after 60 seconds
- Password hashing for secure storage
- Protected routes requiring valid authentication

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive and works on:
- Desktop computers
- Tablets
- Mobile phones

The layout automatically adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across all devices.

---

## 🎨 Theming System

The application includes a comprehensive theming system:
- Light and dark mode support
- System preference detection
- User preference persistence
- Seamless theme switching without page reload
- Consistent color scheme across all components

---

## 🧑‍💻 Development Workflow

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/f3mi/DTS-developer-challenge.git`
2. Set up the backend and frontend as described above
3. Start both servers for development
4. Make changes to the codebase
5. Run tests to ensure functionality
6. Commit changes following the conventional commit format
