## 8. Diagrammatic Presentation Guidelines

To create professional diagrams for wireframes and data models rather than using text-based representations, the following tools and approaches are recommended:

### 8.1 Wireframing Tools

#### Recommended Software
- **Figma**: Collaborative interface design tool with real-time editing
  - Create interactive prototypes
  - Share design systems
  - Cloud-based with team collaboration features
  - URL: https://www.figma.com/

- **Adobe XD**: UX/UI design and prototyping tool
  - Create interactive prototypes
  - Design system support
  - Integration with Adobe Creative Cloud
  - URL: https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html

- **Balsamiq**: Low-fidelity wireframing tool
  - Quick sketching capabilities
  - Focus on structure rather than visual design
  - Suitable for early-stage design
  - URL: https://balsamiq.com/

#### Wireframe Export Formats
- PNG/JPG for static images
- PDF for documentation
- Interactive HTML prototypes
- Design specs for developer handoff

### 8.2 Data Modeling Tools

#### Recommended Software
- **Lucidchart**: Cloud-based diagramming tool
  - Specialized ER diagram templates
  - Real-time collaboration
  - Integration with development tools
  - URL: https://www.lucidchart.com/

- **Draw.io (diagrams.net)**: Free diagramming tool
  - Open-source and browser-based
  - Integration with cloud storage platforms
  - Extensive shape libraries for ER diagrams
  - URL: https://www.diagrams.net/

- **Vertabelo**: Database design tool
  - Physical data model creation
  - SQL generation
  - Reverse engineering from existing databases
  - URL: https://www.vertabelo.com/

#### Data Model Export Formats
- PNG/SVG for documentation
- SQL scripts for database implementation
- XML/JSON for tool interoperability
- PDF for comprehensive documentation

### 8.3 Implementation Guidelines

1. **Wireframe Implementation**
   - Create high-fidelity mockups for key screens identified in section 7.3
   - Develop interactive prototypes for main user flows
   - Export assets in formats suitable for development handoff
   - Store wireframe files in the `/docs/wireframes/` directory

2. **Data Model Implementation**
   - Create formal ER diagrams based on the model in section 7.4
   - Generate SQL scripts from the diagram tools
   - Document relationships with cardinality and constraints
   - Store data model files in the `/docs/data-models/` directory

3. **Naming Conventions**
   - Wireframe files: `tms-wireframe-[screen-name]-[version].ext`
   - Data model files: `tms-data-model-[version].ext`
   - SQL scripts: `tms-schema-[version].sql`

4. **Version Control**
   - Maintain design history with versioned files
   - Document major changes between versions
   - Align diagram versions with software releases
